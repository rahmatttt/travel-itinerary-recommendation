# travel-itinerary-recommendation

This code is about generating a multi-day travel itinerary recommendation using TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) and VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) approaches.
Several optimization algorithms are implemented in this code, such as:
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Tabu Search (TS)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Ant Colony System (ACS)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Branstorm Optimization (BSO)
- Hybrid Ant Colony System and Brainstorm Optimization (Hybrid ACS-BSO)
- Hybrid Ant Colony Optimization (HACO)
- Discrete Komodo Mlipir Algorithm (DKA)

Code for each optimization algorithm can be found in **Optimization** folder

We use the POIs and hotels in Yogyakarta as the dataset of this project obtained from Google Maps API and SerpAPI
